  "content": "Physical health indicators are simpler, cheaper and easier to use than serum biomarkers -advantages that would be of great value in large-scale community studies, daily clinical practice and public health programs. Despite evidence that walking speed 16 , handgrip strength 12 , relative handgrip strength (relative handgrip strength adjusted by body mass index) 17 and peak expiratory flow rate 18 all predict cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, the added clinical benefits of incorporating such physical health indicators into conventional risk estimation models remains uncertain 19 . High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has previously been associated with cardiovascular mortality 6,13 , but the value on routine screening of general population is uncertain 20 . It is of particular interest to know whether adding hs-CRP and the aforementioned physical metrics may provide prognostic information beyond FRS that is salient to the risk of cardiovascular death. Therefore, this national study aimed to investigate whether incorporating hs-CRP, handgrip strength, relative handgrip strength, walking speed, and peak expiratory flow rate into the FRS algorithm would improve its accuracy in predicting the risk of cardiovascular death as well as all-cause mortality. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the whole study cohort and compares differences between men and women. The youngest subject was 53 and the oldest was 85 years old. Median follow-up was 4.1 years, during which 67 participants died (1.8 per 100 person-years at risk), with 20 deaths attributable to cardiovascular disease (0.5 per 100 person-years at risk). Among 748 participants without cardiovascular disease at baseline, 46 died (1.2 per 100 person-years at risk), 11 from cardiovascular disease (0.3 per 100 person-years at risk). There was no participant loss to follow-up in the survival analysis. Table 2 shows ROC-determined optimal cut-off points for stratifying the risk of mortality in this cohort. Handgrip strength and relative handgrip strength had bigger C-statistics than walking speed, peak flow, or hs-CRP. In this study, the cut-off points for relative handgrip strength of 1.40 in women and 2.34 in men had the best discrimination ability, with sensitivity of 80.0% and 70.2% and specificity of 67.4% and 74.2%, respectively. Age and sex adjusted associations of FRS, hs-CRP, dominant handgrip strength, relative handgrip strength, and peak flow rate, with cardiovascular and total mortality were all significant (Table 3). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that FRS, hs-CRP, dominant handgrip strength, relative handgrip strength, and peak flow rate were all significant predictors for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality after 4-year follow-up for the whole sample, as well as the participants without cardiovascular disease at baseline (Table 4). Although walking speed was associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the whole sample and among those without prevalent cardiovascular disease, this association became insignificant after adjusting for age and sex. Discrimination. Incremental C-statistics were examined when hs-CRP and physical health metrics were added to the conventional FRS model: either handgrip strength or relative handgrip strength improved prediction of all-cause mortality in the whole sample and in subjects without prevalent cardiovascular diseases (Table 5). Adding walking speed or peak expiratory flow did not significantly improve FRS predictions for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality; however, either dominant or relative handgrip strength combined with walking speed or peak expiratory flow had higher C-statistics, indicating higher discrimination ability for risk of death. This national population-based cohort study showed significantly improved prediction of all-cause mortality when hs-CRP, dominant or relative handgrip strength were added to the established FRS model. C-statistics for cardiovascular mortality increased when dominant or relative handgrip strength combined with walking speed or peak flow rate were added. These improvements still remained strong even when participants with cardiovascular disease at baseline were excluded; furthermore, these associations remained consistent in three alternative models, with metrics input as continuous or categorized variables, defined according to previous reports, or with optimal cut-offs defined by ROC analysis of this cohort. The overall results not only affirm previous reports 11,12,17,18,[21][22][23] , but show in addition that adding handgrip strength and/or peak flow to the FRS algorithm would improve cardiovascular mortality and all-cause death, which is a novel finding. Walking speed was associated with mortality and predicted 30-day mortality in patients receiving transcatheter valve therapy 16,24 . Although walking speed in this study was inversely associated with cardiovascular mortality and all-cause death in the univariate analysis (Table 3), unlike previous studies 11,16  after adjusting for potential confounders. There are two possible reasons that walking speed did not improve mortality prediction in this study: first, the participants were 10-12 years younger than those in previous reports, which may diminish the accuracy of mortality prediction; second, the mortality risk estimated by walking speed obtained over different distances is known to vary greatly. For example, the risk may be overestimated by using 10-metre walking speed, but underestimated by using 4-metre walking speed 25,26 . This study assessed walking speed over 3-metres. Hs-CRP was independently associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the whole cohort and those without prevalent cardiovascular diseases, consistent with previous reports 6,13,27 . However, the C-statistic increment when adding hs-CRP to FRS did not reach statistical significance in predicting cardiovascular death, consistent with recommendations of the ACC/AHA that hs-CRP assessment should be reserved for those with uncertain risk defined by established qualitative methods (class IIb) 19 , and of the US Preventive Service Task Force not to use hs-CRP for routine screening of the general population 20 . Handgrip strength has previously been associated with mortality 11,12 ; however, some have argued that body size would confound the correlation of handgrip strength with cardiovascular health, and proposed to incorporate body size into muscle strength 28,29 . The Foundation of the United States National Institute of Health has proposed a new index to correct for body size, which divides muscle strength by BMI 30 . Similarly, relative handgrip strength, defined as the totaled handgrip strength of both hands, divided by BMI, was applied to represent muscle strength. Previous reports found that relative handgrip strength was associated with cardiometabolic risk 28,31 , and predicted mobility limitation better than dominant handgrip strength 32 . Results from the study showed that dominant and relative grip strength had very similar predictive values for mortality, which implied that it is appropriate to use the simpler measure i.e. dominant grip strength. Peak expiratory flow is easily measured using a hand-held device in community settings; it is a proxy for the strength of respiratory muscle, and has good prognostic value for mortality and disability 18,33 . In a study of 170000 Chinese men, the association between peak flow and cardiovascular mortality attenuated gradually over 15 years 18 , congruent with previous findings 18,33 . In this study, incorporating peak expiratory flow to FRS combined with relative or dominant handgrip strength significantly improved the prediction of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The C-statistic is a popular discriminatory metric that distinguishes those with outcomes of interest from those without. The significantly increased C-statistics from this study suggest that adding handgrip strength and peak flow would substantially improve the FRS. However, some researchers have questioned sole reliance on the C-statistic to determine the effectiveness of a new indicator because a significant C-statistic increment may require a large degree of independent association 15,34 . The fact that the results of this study remained consistent through all analytic models, subgroup analyses, and statistical analyses, strongly supports the veracity of the findings presented here. This study has important public health implications. First, adding physical health indicators to the FRS significantly improved risk stratification for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Moreover, measurements such as handgrip strength and peak flow are straightforward, convenient, inexpensive, and reliable, which are ideal features of tools used for routine assessments in community studies and clinical practice to better stratify cardiovascular risk. Second, a recent meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials suggested that resistance-training of handgrip strength would improve cardiovascular risk 35 ; it implied that large-scale screening for muscle strength and providing resistance-training programs would greatly benefit overall cardiovascular health. Another advantage of physical indicators is easy comprehension by the general public, and participants would be encouraged if their performance were gradually improved after the program. Third, norms of physical health metrics may differ according to ethnic, socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. Optimal cut-off points of walking speed, dominant and relative handgrip strength and peak flow for mortality prediction provided by this nationally-representative cohort would allow local policymakers and healthcare professionals to mobilize and prioritize resources for those at higher risk. Despite our best efforts this study still had limitations. First, the results of this predominantly Chinese national cohort from Taiwan may not be completely applicable to populations with different ethnic backgrounds. Second, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and other comorbidities were self-reported, rather than extracted from medical records; however, the interviewers did emphasize that self-reported diagnoses should have been made by a physician, which would minimize this potential bias. Third, sex-specific analysis was not performed due to the relatively limited sample size. Fourthly, the exclusion of those with missing data inevitably affected the representativeness of the cohort and the generalizability of the findings; such individuals had lower socioeconomic status in terms of the MacArthur scale of subjective economic status (4.1 ± 2.0 versus 4.4 ± 1.9, p < 0.001) 36 and had a higher mortality rate (19.3% versus 7.4%, p < 0.001). Dominant or relative handgrip strength are accurate, inexpensive and simple physical health indicators that substantially improved FRS risk stratification for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality among community-dwelling middle-aged and older people; these metrics also have considerable potential for evaluating the effectiveness of intervention programs. .
